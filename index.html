    <h1>Giraffes</h1>
    <p>
      Giraffes are one of a kind animals with their long necks and tall heights. These things is what they are best known for, but that's not all that makes them special! Giraffes are pretty fast–they can run up to 35 miles per hour. Their hearts use a special system to get blood up to their heads. Giraffes are truly magnificent creatures, and they deserve to be more known about by us humans.
